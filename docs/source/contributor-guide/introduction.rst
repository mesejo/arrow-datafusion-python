Introduction
============
We welcome and encourage contributions of all kinds, such as:

1. Tickets with issue reports of feature requests
2. Documentation improvements
3. Code, both PR and (especially) PR Review.

In addition to submitting new PRs, we have a healthy tradition of community members reviewing each otherâ€™s PRs.
Doing so is a great way to help the community as well as get more familiar with Rust and the relevant codebases.

How to develop
--------------

This assumes that you have rust and cargo installed. We use the workflow recommended by `pyo3 <https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3>`_ and `maturin <https://github.com/PyO3/maturin>`_.

Bootstrap:

.. code-block:: shell

    # fetch this repo
    git clone git@github.com:apache/arrow-datafusion-python.git
    # prepare development environment (used to build wheel / install in development)
    python3 -m venv venv
    # activate the venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    # update pip itself if necessary
    python -m pip install -U pip
    # install dependencies (for Python 3.8+)
    python -m pip install -r requirements-310.txt

The tests rely on test data in git submodules.

.. code-block:: shell

    git submodule init
    git submodule update


Whenever rust code changes (your changes or via `git pull`):

.. code-block:: shell

   # make sure you activate the venv using "source venv/bin/activate" first
   maturin develop
   python -m pytest


Update Dependencies
-------------------

To change test dependencies, change the `requirements.in` and run

.. code-block:: shell

    # install pip-tools (this can be done only once), also consider running in venv
    python -m pip install pip-tools
    python -m piptools compile --generate-hashes -o requirements-310.txt


To update dependencies, run with `-U`

.. code-block:: shell

   python -m piptools compile -U --generate-hashes -o requirements-310.txt
